我们的app name就叫这个咯：Quantum Leap（ 寓意：“量子跃迁” )
// all exp data at the bottom （可以跟着也可以改，不过要跟着topic，不要跑题）

Part one(goal tracker)
First,要有career let user choose, this career has long-term and short-term, so后面的part要跟着这个goal来连接
Coding: 要print out career(at least 6) and detail(long-term and short-term), let the user choose only one career.
        After choosing, must have a button like submit, get the user to click, so that can connect to part two and three
if can 就用我给的data(career)
-Example 1: Full-Stack Developer Path
-Example 2: AI / Machine Learning Engineer Path
-Example 3: DevOps / Site Reliability Engineer (SRE) Path
-Example 4: Mobile Development Specialist (iOS) Path
-Example 5: Cybersecurity Engineer (Offensive Security) Path
-Example 6: Data Engineer Path

Part two(skills log) //（可以直接自己测试先做的，创造一个Checkpoint or button什么的，click了会连去你的part的部分）
基于前面选的career的long-term and short-term，set要学习什么skills，
- 添加目标：短期（3-6个月）/长期（1-5年）
- 设置截止日期和优先级
- 目标进度条可视化（0-100%）
-添加技能（如：Python、SQL、Teamwork）
- 学习记录：课程名称，完成日期
-其他功能自己要加也是可以 (我没idea了其实）

Part three(task planner)// （可以直接自己测试先做的，创造一个Checkpoint or button什么的，click了会连去你的part的部分）
也是基于career是什么，就推荐什么daily task plan
-添加一天的任务
-可设置日期
-时间块分配（如：9-10AM学习Python）
-标记已完成/未完成
-显示任务列表（checkbox）
加分功能（可选）：
-简单日历（Python 自带 calendar 模块）
